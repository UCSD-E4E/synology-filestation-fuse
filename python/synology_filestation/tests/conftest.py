"""Pytest fixtures shared by the binding tests.

The fixtures use ``pytest_httpserver`` to stand up a tiny real HTTP server on a
random port and point a real ``synology_filestation.Client`` at it. We can't
mock the HTTP layer in Python because the requests are issued from Rust
(reqwest); the only seam is the network itself.
