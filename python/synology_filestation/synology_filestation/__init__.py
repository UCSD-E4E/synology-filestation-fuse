"""Synology FileStation client for Python.

A drop-in replacement for the ``synology-api`` PyPI package's FileStation
surface with three concrete behavior fixes:

1. DSM JSON-error responses raise typed exceptions instead of returning
   success-shaped empty data.
2. ``download_to`` writes atomically (temp file + rename) so a failed
   download never leaves a 0-byte stub at the destination.
3. ``Client.login(..., auto_relogin=True)`` (the default) transparently
   re-authenticates on SID-expired errors and retries the operation once.

See the project README for the exception hierarchy and usage examples.
