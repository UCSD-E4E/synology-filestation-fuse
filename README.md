# synology-filestation

Tools for working with Synology [FileStation](https://www.synology.com/en-global/dsm/feature/file_station) from outside DSM. The repo ships two related products from a single shared HTTP-client core:

**Filesystem driver** — mount a FileStation share as a local directory:
- **Linux** — FUSE via the `fuser` crate
- **macOS** — local WebDAV proxy; no kernel extension required
- **Windows** — user-mode filesystem via [WinFsp](https://winfsp.dev/)
- **GUI (all platforms)** — Avalonia desktop app for point-and-click mounting; calls the Rust core in-process (no subprocess), with a connecting spinner, a **Test Connection** check, and a pre-mount file browser

**Python package** (`pip install synology-filestation`) — typed exceptions, atomic downloads, transparent SID-expiry recovery; a drop-in replacement for the `synology-api` PyPI package's FileStation surface. Includes an [fsspec](https://filesystem-spec.readthedocs.io/) backend registered as protocol `synofs` so it composes with pandas / dask / polars / pyarrow. See [python/synology_filestation/README.md](python/synology_filestation/README.md).

## Features

- Browse and navigate directories
- Read and write files
- Create and delete files and directories
- Rename files (same-directory) and move files (cross-directory)
- Interactive password prompt with hidden input when password is not set via flag or environment variable
- 2FA / TOTP support
- Uses `rustls` — no OpenSSL dependency required
- **Linux:** metadata cache with configurable TTL; block-level read cache (default 256 MiB) with background prefetch
- **macOS:** no kernel extension; uses macOS's built-in WebDAV filesystem support
- **Windows:** user-mode filesystem via WinFsp; mounts as a drive letter (e.g. `Z:`)
- **GUI (all platforms):** Avalonia app that calls the Rust core directly through a native library (no subprocess) — connecting spinner, **Test Connection**, typed error messages, inline 2FA prompt, live log output, a pre-mount file browser (browse / download / upload / delete / new folder with transfer progress), and settings persistence

## Linux installation

Download the `.deb` package from the [Releases](../../releases) page:

```
synologyfuse-<version>_amd64.deb
```

Install with `apt` (which also satisfies the `libfuse3-3` dependency automatically):

```bash
sudo apt install ./synologyfuse-<version>_amd64.deb
```

This places the CLI at `/usr/bin/synology-filestation-fuse`, the GUI and its .NET runtime (plus the native `libsynology_filestation_ffi.so` the GUI loads) at `/opt/SynologyFuse/`, and a desktop launcher in your application menu.

To build the package yourself, see [Building the installer](#building-the-installer) below.

## macOS installation

Download the `.pkg` installer from the [Releases](../../releases) page:

```
SynologyFuse-<version>.pkg
```

The installer places `SynologyFuse.app` in `/Applications/` and symlinks the CLI to `/usr/local/bin/synology-filestation-fuse`. Administrator privileges are required. macOS 12 (Monterey) or later is required.

> **Gatekeeper note:** Because the package is currently unsigned, macOS may block it on first open. Right-click the `.pkg` and choose **Open**, then confirm in the dialog.

To build the installer yourself, see [Building the installer](#building-the-installer) below.

## Windows installation

The easiest way to install on Windows is to download the bundle installer from the [Releases](../../releases) page:

```
SynologyFuse-<version>-Setup.exe
```

The installer includes [WinFsp](https://winfsp.dev/) and automatically installs it if it is not already present, then installs SynologyFuse to `%ProgramFiles%\SynologyFuse\` and adds it to the system `PATH`. A **SynologyFuse GUI** shortcut is placed in the Start Menu.

To build the installer yourself, see [Building the installer](#building-the-installer) below.

## Nix installation

The repository ships a flake exposing both binaries as packages:

| Output | Installs the command | Contents |
|---|---|---|
| `synology-filestation-fuse` (also `default`) | `synology-filestation-fuse` | The Rust CLI |
| `synology-filestation-ffi` | *(library only)* | The native C ABI library (cdylib) the GUI loads |
| `synologyfuse-gui` | **`SynologyFuse.Gui`** | The .NET 10 / Avalonia desktop GUI |

Note the GUI's package name and its command differ: you install `synologyfuse-gui` but you run `SynologyFuse.Gui`.

The GUI calls the Rust core directly through the native library, so the `synologyfuse-gui` package wraps its launcher with `SYNOFS_NATIVE_DIR` pointing at the cdylib (and the CLI on `PATH` too) — installing or running the GUI alone is enough to mount. Install `synology-filestation-fuse` as well if you also want the CLI available directly in your shell.

### Try it without installing

```bash
nix run github:UCSD-E4E/synology-filestation          # CLI
nix run github:UCSD-E4E/synology-filestation#gui       # GUI (its wrapper puts the CLI on PATH)
```

### Imperative (user profile)

```bash
# GUI (self-contained), plus the CLI for direct shell use:
nix profile install \
  github:UCSD-E4E/synology-filestation#synologyfuse-gui \
  github:UCSD-E4E/synology-filestation#synology-filestation-fuse

SynologyFuse.Gui            # launch the GUI
synology-filestation-fuse   # …or the CLI
```

### Declarative (NixOS flake)

Add the flake as an input and pull the packages into `environment.systemPackages`:

```nix
{
  inputs = {
    nixpkgs.url = "github:NixOS/nixpkgs/nixos-unstable";
    synology-filestation.url = "github:UCSD-E4E/synology-filestation";
    # Reuse your system's nixpkgs instead of evaluating a second copy:
    synology-filestation.inputs.nixpkgs.follows = "nixpkgs";
  };

  outputs = { self, nixpkgs, synology-filestation, ... }: {
    nixosConfigurations.YOUR_HOST = nixpkgs.lib.nixosSystem {
      system = "x86_64-linux";
      modules = [
        ./configuration.nix
        ({ pkgs, ... }: {
          environment.systemPackages = [
            synology-filestation.packages.${pkgs.system}.synology-filestation-fuse
            synology-filestation.packages.${pkgs.system}.synologyfuse-gui   # optional
          ];

          # Required for non-root FUSE mounting (see below).
          programs.fuse.userAllowOther = true;
        })
      ];
    };
  };
}
```

Then `sudo nixos-rebuild switch --flake .#YOUR_HOST`. For [Home Manager](https://nix-community.github.io/home-manager/), use the same packages in `home.packages` instead.

On NixOS the CLI mounts via a setuid `fusermount3`; if you hit `fusermount3: permission denied`, the `programs.fuse.userAllowOther = true` option above provides it (this is the NixOS equivalent of the [`/etc/fuse.conf` step](#linux-fuse-configuration-allow_other) below).

### Develop against the flake

`nix develop` drops you into a shell with the Rust toolchain (clippy/rustfmt), `pkg-config` + `fuse3`, the Python binding toolchain (`uv`, `maturin`, `python3`), and the .NET 10 SDK — everything needed to build every component in this repo. `nix flake check` runs the CLI build, clippy, rustfmt, and the GUI build + test suite.

Supported systems: `x86_64-linux`, `aarch64-linux`, `x86_64-darwin`, `aarch64-darwin`.

## Requirements

### System

- **Linux:** kernel with FUSE support (`/dev/fuse`) and `libfuse3` runtime (`libfuse3-3` on Ubuntu/Debian)
- **macOS:** macOS 10.15+ (no third-party kernel extension needed)
- **Windows:** [WinFsp](https://winfsp.dev/rel/) installed (free, open-source); the `WinFsp.Launcher` service must be running
- A Synology NAS running DSM with FileStation API enabled

### Build

- Rust toolchain (1.70+) — install via [rustup](https://rustup.rs)
- **Linux only:** `libfuse3-dev` (Ubuntu/Debian) or `fuse3-devel` (Fedora/RHEL)
- **Windows only:** [WinFsp](https://winfsp.dev/rel/) installed (the build links against `winfsp-x64.dll`)
- **GUI (all platforms):** [.NET 10 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download)
- **macOS installer only:** Xcode Command Line Tools — provides `pkgbuild`, `productbuild`, and `iconutil` (`xcode-select --install`)
- **Windows installer only:** `wix` dotnet tool (`dotnet tool install --global wix`)

```bash
# Ubuntu / Debian
sudo apt-get install libfuse3-dev

# Fedora / RHEL
sudo dnf install fuse3-devel
```

macOS requires no additional build dependencies.

**Windows note:** build from a **Developer Command Prompt**, **Developer PowerShell**, or any terminal where `vcvarsall.bat` has been sourced. Git Bash ships its own `link.exe` (a hard-link utility) that shadows MSVC's linker and will cause a build failure. If you must use Git Bash, set the linker explicitly via the environment variable:

```bash
export CARGO_TARGET_X86_64_PC_WINDOWS_MSVC_LINKER="C:/Program Files/Microsoft Visual Studio/.../link.exe"
```

### Linux FUSE configuration (allow_other)

By default, a FUSE mount is only accessible to the user who created it.
The driver attempts to enable `allow_other` so that other users (and root) can
also access the mount. On Ubuntu 24.04 and other distributions that ship
`fusermount3`, this requires `user_allow_other` to be set in `/etc/fuse.conf`.

If that option is not present, the driver falls back to mounting **without**
`allow_other` and logs a warning — the mount still works for the mounting user.

To enable access for all users, edit `/etc/fuse.conf` and uncomment (or add) the
`user_allow_other` line:

```bash
# /etc/fuse.conf
# Allow non-root users to specify the allow_other or allow_root mount options
user_allow_other
```

You can do this in one command:

```bash
# If the line exists but is commented out, uncomment it;
# otherwise append it (handles fresh installs where the line is absent).
if grep -qE '^[[:space:]]*user_allow_other' /etc/fuse.conf 2>/dev/null; then
    : # already enabled — nothing to do
elif grep -qE '^#[[:space:]]*user_allow_other' /etc/fuse.conf 2>/dev/null; then
    sudo sed -i 's/^#[[:space:]]*user_allow_other/user_allow_other/' /etc/fuse.conf
else
    echo 'user_allow_other' | sudo tee -a /etc/fuse.conf
fi
```

After saving the file, remount and all users will be able to access the share.

**On NixOS**, `/etc/fuse.conf` is generated and the commands above will not
stick. Set the option instead:

```nix
programs.fuse.userAllowOther = true;
```

## Building

### CLI (all platforms)

```bash
cargo build --release -p synology-filestation-fuse
```

The binary will be at `target/release/synology-filestation-fuse`.

The repo is a Cargo workspace; `-p synology-filestation-fuse` keeps the build scoped to the FUSE binary and its `synology-filestation-core` library dependency. Building the whole workspace also pulls in [`python/synology_filestation/`](python/synology_filestation/), which requires Python development headers — see [the Python package's README](python/synology_filestation/README.md) for that.

### GUI (all platforms)

The GUI is a self-contained .NET 10 / Avalonia application. Build it for any platform with:

```bash
# Linux (x64)
dotnet publish SynologyFuse.Gui -c Release -r linux-x64 -p:SelfContained=true

# macOS (Apple Silicon)
dotnet publish SynologyFuse.Gui -c Release -r osx-arm64 -p:SelfContained=true

# macOS (Intel)
dotnet publish SynologyFuse.Gui -c Release -r osx-x64 -p:SelfContained=true

# Windows (x64)
dotnet publish SynologyFuse.Gui -c Release -r win-x64 -p:SelfContained=true
```

Output goes to `SynologyFuse.Gui/bin/Release/net10.0/<rid>/publish/`. The GUI calls the Rust core through the native FFI library (`libsynology_filestation_ffi.{so,dylib}` / `synology_filestation_ffi.dll`); build it with `cargo build --release -p synology-filestation-ffi` and place it beside the GUI executable. The resolver searches, in order: the `SYNOFS_NATIVE_DIR` environment variable (explicit override), then beside the GUI (deployed layout), then `target/{release,debug}/` relative to the repo root (development layout). The platform installers bundle the library automatically.

### Building the installer

#### Linux (Debian/Ubuntu .deb)

**Prerequisites (one-time):**

```bash
sudo apt-get install dpkg-dev
```

**Build (all-in-one):**

```bash
./SynologyFuse.DebInstaller/Build-Package.sh --build
# Produces: SynologyFuse.DebInstaller/synologyfuse-0.1.2_amd64.deb
```

Pass `--build` to compile the Rust CLI and publish the .NET GUI automatically. Omit it if you have already run `cargo build --release -p synology-filestation-fuse` and `dotnet publish` yourself. Use `--arch arm64` to target 64-bit ARM instead of x86-64 (default: `amd64`).

The package installs:

| Path | Contents |
|---|---|
| `/usr/bin/synology-filestation-fuse` | CLI binary |
| `/opt/SynologyFuse/` | GUI executable, .NET runtime, and `libsynology_filestation_ffi.so` |
| `/usr/share/applications/synologyfuse.desktop` | Application menu entry |
| `/usr/share/icons/hicolor/256x256/apps/synologyfuse.png` | Application icon |

Runtime dependency: `libfuse3-3` (pulled in automatically by `apt install`).

#### macOS

**Prerequisites (one-time):**

```bash
xcode-select --install   # provides pkgbuild, productbuild, iconutil
```

**Build (all-in-one):**

```bash
./SynologyFuse.MacInstaller/Build-Installer.sh --build
# Produces: SynologyFuse.MacInstaller/SynologyFuse-0.1.2.pkg
```

Pass `--build` to compile the Rust CLI and publish the .NET GUI automatically. Omit it if you have already run `cargo build --release -p synology-filestation-fuse` and `dotnet publish` yourself. Use `--arch x86_64` to target Intel Macs instead of Apple Silicon (default: `arm64`).

#### Windows

Two Windows installers are available:

| File | What it contains | Use when |
|---|---|---|
| `SynologyFuse-<ver>.msi` | SynologyFuse only | WinFsp is already installed |
| `SynologyFuse-<ver>-Setup.exe` | WinFsp + SynologyFuse | Fresh Windows machine |

**Prerequisites (one-time):**

```powershell
dotnet tool install --global wix
wix extension add WixToolset.Bal.wixext
wix extension add WixToolset.Util.wixext
```

**Build the MSI only:**

```powershell
# From repo root — build Rust CLI and .NET GUI first
cargo build -r -p synology-filestation-fuse
dotnet publish SynologyFuse.Gui -c Release -r win-x64 -p:SelfContained=true

msbuild SynologyFuse.Installer\SynologyFuse.Installer.wixproj
# Produces: SynologyFuse.Installer\SynologyFuse-0.1.2.msi
```

**Build the bundle (MSI + WinFsp):**

```powershell
# Build Rust CLI and .NET GUI first (same as above), then:
msbuild SynologyFuse.Installer\SynologyFuse.Installer.wixproj
.\SynologyFuse.Installer\Build-Bundle.ps1
# Downloads WinFsp automatically, then produces:
# SynologyFuse.Installer\SynologyFuse-0.1.2-Setup.exe
```

The bundle script downloads `winfsp-2.1.25156.msi` from GitHub to `SynologyFuse.Installer\redist\` (cached for subsequent builds).

## Usage

```bash
synology-filestation-fuse --host <NAS_HOST> -u <USERNAME> [OPTIONS] <MOUNTPOINT>
```

### Arguments

| Argument | Description | Default |
|---|---|---|
| `<MOUNTPOINT>` | Directory to mount on. On macOS must be under `/Volumes/` (e.g. `/Volumes/nas`). On Windows must be an empty directory (e.g. `C:\mnt\nas`) | *(required)* |
| `--host <HOST>` | NAS hostname or IP address | *(required)* |
| `-u, --username` | NAS account username | *(required)* |
| `-p, --password` | NAS account password (or `SYNO_PASSWORD` env var; prompted with hidden input if omitted) | *(optional)* |
| `--otp <CODE>` | TOTP code for 2FA (or `SYNO_OTP` env var); prompted interactively if omitted and 2FA is enabled | *(optional)* |
| `--port <PORT>` | API port | `5001` |
| `--https` | Use HTTPS | `true` |
| `--password-stdin` | Read the password from the first line of stdin. Prefer this in scripts: `--password` puts the password in argv, where any local account can read it with `ps`. | `false` |
| `--insecure` | Accept any TLS certificate (self-signed, expired, wrong hostname). Needed for a stock DSM certificate; the connection is then encrypted but **not** authenticated. Env: `SYNO_INSECURE` | `false` |
| `--cache-ttl <SECS>` | Metadata cache TTL in seconds *(Linux only)* | `30` |
| `--read-cache-mb <MiB>` | Read cache size in MiB *(Linux only)* | `256` |
| `--prefetch-blocks <N>` | Speculative read-ahead depth in 256 KiB blocks; `0` disables it. Read-ahead only fires for a reader that is streaming, and the window at open only for a container that keeps its index at the end. A bulk walk over a corpus reads each file once, so it wants `0` *(Linux only)* | `16` |
| `--uid <UID>` | Owner reported for every mounted entry. DSM's own uids name accounts on the appliance, not on this machine, so they are never used *(Linux only)* | *(mounting user)* |
| `--gid <GID>` | Group reported for every mounted entry *(Linux only)* | *(mounting user's group)* |
| `--umask <MASK>` | Octal umask for the permissions the mount reports; `022` gives `0755` directories and `0644` files *(Linux only)* | `022` |
| `--log-level <LEVEL>` | Log level (`error`, `warn`, `info`, `debug`, `trace`) | `info` |

### Examples

```bash
# Mount — password will be prompted securely if not supplied
# Linux
mkdir -p /mnt/nas
synology-filestation-fuse --host 192.168.1.100 -u admin /mnt/nas

# macOS (mountpoint must be under /Volumes/)
synology-filestation-fuse --host 192.168.1.100 -u admin /Volumes/nas
# Password: ********

# Windows (mountpoint must be an empty directory)
synology-filestation-fuse.exe --host 192.168.1.100 -u admin C:\mnt\nas

# Pass password via flag
synology-filestation-fuse --host 192.168.1.100 -u admin -p mypassword /mnt/nas

# Pass password via environment variable
export SYNO_PASSWORD=mypassword
synology-filestation-fuse --host nas.local -u admin /mnt/nas

# With two-factor authentication (TOTP code passed directly)
synology-filestation-fuse --host 192.168.1.100 -u admin --otp 123456 /mnt/nas

# With 2FA via environment variable
SYNO_OTP=123456 synology-filestation-fuse --host 192.168.1.100 -u admin /mnt/nas

# With 2FA enabled but no code supplied — will prompt interactively:
#   Two-factor authentication code: ______
synology-filestation-fuse --host 192.168.1.100 -u admin /mnt/nas

# Mount over plain HTTP (DSM default HTTP port)
synology-filestation-fuse --host 192.168.1.100 --port 5000 --no-https -u admin /mnt/nas

# Linux: larger read cache for smoother playback of large video files
synology-filestation-fuse --host nas.local -u admin --read-cache-mb 512 /mnt/nas

# Enable debug logging
synology-filestation-fuse --host nas.local -u admin --log-level debug /mnt/nas

# Unmount (Linux)
fusermount -u /mnt/nas

# Unmount (macOS — or eject in Finder)
diskutil unmount /Volumes/nas

# Unmount (Windows — press Ctrl-C in the terminal running the driver,
# or right-click the drive in Explorer and choose Eject / Disconnect)
```

### GUI

`SynologyFuse.Gui` is a cross-platform Avalonia application that calls the Rust core **in-process** through the `synology-filestation-ffi` cdylib via P/Invoke — it does not spawn the CLI. It provides:

- Form fields for host, username, password, OTP, mountpoint, and advanced options (cache TTL, read cache size, log level)
- **Connect** (login + mount), **Test Connection** (login only), and **Disconnect** (unmount + logout), with a connecting spinner while a call is in flight
- Typed error reporting — the native layer returns structured errors (with the DSM code), so messages are accurate instead of scraped from log text
- Inline 2FA prompt: when login reports that an OTP is required, the GUI shows an input banner and retries the connect with the code (entered once, then reused for the mount)
- A pre-mount **file browser** ([`FileBrowserWindow`](SynologyFuse.Gui/Views/FileBrowserWindow.axaml)) that lists shares/directories and supports download, upload, delete, and new-folder with a transfer progress bar — all without mounting
- Live log output, bridged from the native library's `tracing` events via a log callback
- Settings persistence — connection parameters are saved to the platform settings directory and reloaded on next launch

The P/Invoke surface lives in `SynologyFuse.Gui/Interop/` (`NativeMethods.cs` declarations + native-library resolver, `SynoException.cs`); `Services/SynoClient.cs` is the managed wrapper and `Services/MountService.cs` orchestrates connect/mount/test.

### Virtual root

The mountpoint root is a synthetic directory that does not correspond to any real path on the NAS. Reading it calls `SYNO.FileStation.List list_share` to enumerate all shares the authenticated account can see. Each share appears as a subdirectory.

### macOS WebDAV backend

On macOS the binary starts a local HTTP server (`127.0.0.1:<random port>`) that speaks WebDAV, then calls the macOS built-in `mount_webdav` to attach it at the requested mountpoint. This uses Apple's own `webdavfs` kernel support — no third-party kernel extension is required. The process exits cleanly on Ctrl-C or when the volume is ejected from Finder.

WebDAV operations map to FileStation API calls:

| WebDAV | FileStation |
|---|---|
| `PROPFIND /` | `list_share` |
| `PROPFIND /path` | `getinfo` + `list` |
| `GET /path` (Range) | `download` |
| `PUT /path` | `upload` |
| `DELETE /path` | `delete` |
| `MKCOL /path` | `CreateFolder` |
| `MOVE` (same dir) | `rename` |
| `MOVE` (cross dir) | `download` → `upload` → `delete` |

### Windows WinFsp backend

On Windows the binary registers a user-mode filesystem with WinFsp and mounts it at the specified drive letter (e.g. `Z:`). WinFsp acts as a kernel-mode bridge: the Windows kernel forwards filesystem requests to our process via the WinFsp driver, which calls our `FileSystemContext` callbacks synchronously.

WinFsp callbacks map to FileStation API calls:

| WinFsp callback | FileStation |
|---|---|
| `get_security_by_name` | `getinfo` (or pending-file registry hit) |
| `open` | `getinfo` |
| `create` | *(deferred — file data buffered in memory)* |
| `read` | `download` (byte-range) |
| `write` | *(buffered in memory)* |
| `flush` / `close` | `upload` |
| `rename` (same dir, buffered) | `upload` direct to new name |
| `rename` (same dir, on NAS) | `rename` |
| `rename` (cross dir) | `download` → `upload` → `delete` |
| `cleanup` (delete flag) | `delete` |
| `read_directory` | `list_share` or `list` |
| `create` (directory) | `CreateFolder` |

Because the Synology Upload API requires the complete file body in a single multipart request, new and modified files are buffered in memory and uploaded atomically on `flush()`, `rename()`, or `close()`. During the write phase the file is tracked in an in-process pending-file registry so that concurrent opens (e.g. from an atomic write pattern) can locate the buffered data without a NAS round-trip.

Rename handling normalises the destination path case: Windows may supply the destination in a different case than the NAS directories (which are on a Linux, case-sensitive filesystem). The driver always uses the source path's parent (correct mixed-case) for uploads and same-directory renames.

### Linux FUSE backend

The FUSE dispatch loop (inside `fuser::mount2`) is synchronous. All Synology API calls are async via `reqwest`. The driver bridges these by holding a `tokio::runtime::Handle` and calling `handle.block_on(future)` inside each FUSE callback.

File data is cached in fixed-size 256 KiB blocks using a `moka` LRU cache (default 256 MiB). Background prefetch of the next 16 blocks keeps streaming reads smooth.

### Write buffering (all platforms)

The Synology Upload API requires the complete file body as a single multipart upload. Write data is accumulated in an in-memory buffer per open file handle and flushed to the NAS on close. Large file writes consume proportional memory.

## Known Limitations

- **Cross-directory directory moves are not supported.** Moving a directory to a different parent returns `ENOSYS` / `STATUS_UNSUCCESSFUL`. Only same-directory renames use the efficient `SYNO.FileStation.Rename` API.
- **Cross-directory file moves are not atomic.** They are implemented as download → upload → delete. A failure mid-sequence may leave data duplicated or missing.
- **Large files require large in-memory write buffers.** Writing to a file buffers the entire file content in process memory until the file is closed or flushed.
- **Overwriting a file is not atomic.** The existing file is deleted before the new content is uploaded; a crash between those two steps would result in data loss.
- **No support for symlinks, hard links, or special files.**
- **Linux only:** Inode numbers are not stable across remounts. Permissions and timestamps are read-only (`chmod`, `chown`, `utimens` appear to succeed but are not persisted).
- **Windows only:** The mountpoint must be an empty directory (e.g. `C:\mnt\nas`); mounting directly as a drive letter (e.g. `Z:`) is not currently supported.

## Synology API Reference

All requests go to `/webapi/entry.cgi` (authentication uses `/webapi/auth.cgi`).

| Operation | API | Method |
|---|---|---|
| Login | `SYNO.API.Auth` | `login` |
| Logout | `SYNO.API.Auth` | `logout` |
| List shares | `SYNO.FileStation.List` | `list_share` |
| List directory | `SYNO.FileStation.List` | `list` |
| Get file info | `SYNO.FileStation.List` | `getinfo` |
| Download file | `SYNO.FileStation.Download` | `download` |
| Upload file | `SYNO.FileStation.Upload` | `upload` |
| Delete | `SYNO.FileStation.Delete` | `delete` |
| Create folder | `SYNO.FileStation.CreateFolder` | `create` |
| Rename | `SYNO.FileStation.Rename` | `rename` |

## Contributing

This project uses [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/). Commit messages determine the next version number automatically via [release-please](https://github.com/googleapis/release-please):

| Commit prefix | Example | Version bump |
|---|---|---|
| `fix:` | `fix: handle HTTP 416 as EOF` | patch (`0.1.0` → `0.1.1`) |
| `feat:` | `feat: add read cache` | minor (`0.1.0` → `0.2.0`) |
| `feat!:` or `BREAKING CHANGE:` footer | `feat!: change CLI flag names` | minor while pre-1.0 (`0.3.0` → `0.4.0`) |

While the project is pre-1.0, `bump-minor-pre-major` keeps a breaking change on the minor track rather than reaching for `1.0.0`; the jump to `1.0.0` is a deliberate act, not something a `!` triggers.

Other prefixes (`docs:`, `chore:`, `refactor:`, `test:`, etc.) do not trigger a release.

When a qualifying commit lands on `main`, release-please opens a PR that bumps the version in `Cargo.toml` and updates `CHANGELOG.md`. Merging that PR creates a GitHub release and tag.
