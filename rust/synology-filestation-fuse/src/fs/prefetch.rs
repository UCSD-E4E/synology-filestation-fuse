//! What to fetch before the caller asks for it, and when not to bother.
//!
//! The mount speculates twice: once at `open`, to make a video file playable
//! at all, and once per `read`, to keep a streaming reader's pipe full. Both
//! used to be unconditional, which meant a 48 KiB header read of a 5.5 MiB
//! JPEG pulled ~5 MiB off the appliance and threw away all but the header.
//!
//! The two windows are not symmetric, and that asymmetry is the whole design:
//!
//! * The **head** is reachable by watching the access pattern. A player
//!   parsing a faststart MP4's `moov` reads contiguously from block 0, so a
//!   ramp that grows on sequential reads gets there on its own.
//! * The **tail** is reachable by nothing. A seek to EOF — which is how a
//!   player finds the `moov` of a file written without faststart, i.e. most
//!   camera and plain `ffmpeg` output — is by definition not sequential, so
//!   no access-pattern heuristic can ever predict it. It has to be fetched
//!   eagerly or not at all.
//!
//! So the tail window is decided at open time from what the file *is*, not
//! from what the caller has done so far, and block 0 is already in hand at
//! exactly that point (`open` downloads it synchronously) — which makes
//! sniffing the container magic free.
