//! What the tunnel does when it cannot do what was asked.
//!
//! The happy path needs a server: an OpenVPN daemon to hand a real handshake
//! to, and a NAS behind it. Both exist — the openvpn crate drives an actual
//! `openvpn` process, and completes a whole TCP conversation against an
//! in-process peer — and neither belongs here. What belongs here is the layer
//! this crate adds: reading the profile, turning a decision's address into a
//! destination, and failing in a way that says which of those went wrong.
//!
//! That matters more than it sounds. Every one of these reaches a user as "the
//! tunnel didn't come up", and the difference between a profile that was never
//! fetched and a NAS that is not answering is the difference between a fix and
//! a shrug.
