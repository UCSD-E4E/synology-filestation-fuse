//! Which way to reach the NAS, and when to look again.
//!
//! Three legs, best first: SMB straight to the appliance, SMB through a
//! tunnel, and the HTTP FileStation API. They are not equivalent — SMB
//! addresses byte ranges, so a write that dies at 540 MiB resumes at 540 MiB,
//! while the HTTP upload has no resume and loses the file. The chain exists so
//! a user on a network that blocks port 445 still gets their file across,
//! without everyone else paying for that.
//!
//! ## The shape of the decision
//!
//! A tunnel is not a peer of the other two: it is a *precondition* that can
//! make SMB reachable. So `--disable-vpn` does not remove a transport, it
//! forbids the escalation, and a user on a locked-down network falls straight
//! from SMB to HTTP with no tunnel dialog.
//!
//! ## Why the choice is cached
//!
//! Every operation asks which transport to use, and probing per operation
//! would put a TCP connect in front of every `stat`. So the answer is decided
//! once and cached, and the cache expires **only while degraded**: sitting on
//! the best leg there is nothing better to find, so nothing is probed and
//! steady state costs nothing. Demotion does not wait for the cache — a
//! backend that starts failing trips its own circuit breaker in
//! `synology-filestation-core`, which is what makes a dead link cheap instead
//! of a ten-second timeout per call.
