//! The escalation, carried out.
//!
//! [`Chain`](crate::Chain) decides that SMB needs a tunnel; this is the thing
//! that raises one. It is the only place in the workspace that knows both
//! halves — the decision layer above and the OpenVPN client below — which is
//! why it lives here rather than in either.
//!
//! Nothing about it touches the operating system's network. The tunnel
//! terminates in this process, a userspace TCP stack sits on it, and what
//! comes back out is a byte stream like any other. No tun device, no
//! `CAP_NET_ADMIN`, no privileged helper, no installer component, and no
//! effect on anything else the machine is doing.
//!
//! ## One tunnel per connection
//!
//! Every call raises a fresh one. That sounds wasteful and is the honest
//! shape: the connection is what the caller asked for, an OpenVPN session
//! carries exactly one here, and a session that has died is usually why the
//! caller is asking again. Keeping a tunnel alive between calls would mean
//! deciding when to tear it down, which is a question nothing here can answer
//! and [`Chain`](crate::Chain) already answers in its own terms.
