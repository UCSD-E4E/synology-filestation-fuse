//! An in-process OpenVPN client.
//!
//! e4e-nas terminates an OpenVPN tunnel itself so that off-campus researchers
//! can reach SMB on the appliance and nothing else. Using it should not require
//! a tun device, `CAP_NET_ADMIN`, a privileged helper or an installer
//! component, and it should not touch the rest of the machine's traffic — so
//! this crate speaks the protocol in the same process as the mount, and the
//! bytes it recovers are handed to a userspace TCP stack rather than to the
//! kernel.
//!
//! What is here so far is the control channel's envelope: the static key, the
//! packet framing, and the `tls-auth` HMAC that the server checks *before* it
//! will do any TLS work at all. That ordering is the reason this is the first
//! piece — a client that gets the HMAC wrong does not get an error back, it
//! gets silence.
//!
//! Everything is pinned against packets a real OpenVPN client emitted; see
//! `tests/wire_format.rs`.
