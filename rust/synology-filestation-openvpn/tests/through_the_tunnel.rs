//! A TCP conversation, end to end, through a tunnel that really encrypts.
//!
//! Every piece of this crate has been tested against something: the wire
//! format against captured bytes, the key derivation against OpenSSL, the
//! protocol against a real `openvpn`, the TCP stack against a peer on an
//! in-memory link. What none of them cover is all of it at once — and the
//! joins are where this kind of thing goes wrong, quietly, in a way that looks
//! like the network.
//!
//! So: a tunnel to a peer over a real socket, a TCP connection opened through
//! it, and bytes going both ways. The peer decrypts what arrives, hands it to
//! a `smoltcp` interface listening where the NAS would be, and encrypts
//! whatever that interface says back. Nothing on this machine routes
//! 10.90.24.1 and nothing is asked to.
//!
//! What it still cannot prove is that a real DSM answers. That is the live
//! pass, and it needs a person.
