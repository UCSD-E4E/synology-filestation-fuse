//! Pluggable read/write **backends** and the health tracking that lets
//! [`SynologyClient`](crate::SynologyClient) prefer them over the HTTP
//! FileStation API — while transparently falling back to HTTP when a backend is
//! unavailable.
//!
//! The motivation is the NAS-saturation incident: the HTTP Download/Upload API
//! is proxied through the shared `synoscgi` backend, so a bulk transfer load can
//! take the appliance down. An alternative transport (SMB today; NFS, S3, or a
//! cache tomorrow) that talks to a *different* service relieves it. Backends
//! plug in by **dependency inversion**: they implement [`ReadTransport`] /
//! [`WriteTransport`] here, and consumers inject them at construction — the
//! read/write call sites (`download`/`upload`) never change, and this crate
//! never depends on any backend's protocol library.
//!
//! ## Error contract (the integration seam)
//!
//! An implementor maps its failures onto [`SynoFsError`] so the selection layer
//! can distinguish, via [`SynoFsError::category`]:
//!
//! * **transient** (connection lost / timeout / transport) → `Transport` — the
//!   selection layer trips this backend's [`CircuitBreaker`] and falls back;
//! * **definitive** (not-found / permission / …) → propagate unchanged; the
//!   backend is healthy and gave a real answer, so falling back would just ask
//!   the same NAS the same question.
//!
//! ## Write contract
//!
//! [`WriteTransport::write`] MUST NOT leave a partial/corrupt target: on success
//! the whole file is replaced; on failure the previous file is preserved
//! (**old-or-new**, never a partial, no data lost). That is what makes fallback
//! *safe* — a failed primary write can't leave a half-file for the HTTP path (or
//! another backend) to collide with. It need not be a single atomic operation.
